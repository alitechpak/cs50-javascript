#   Fasting alarm web app for **Madani Channel**
##  Background
*   In Ramadan I saw on **Madani Channel** that sehri timings were going to rotate even after time finished.

__*So I decided to make an app*__
*   List down selected cities along with
    *   Sehri Time
    *   Iftar Time
*   Rotate slide in such a way that
    *   When time passed a city should automatically drop from List
    *   Above running slide, there should be a list of five cities automatically updating with color codes
        *   Green == 5 minutes remaining
        *   Red == Only 20 seconds left.
